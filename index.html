            Context: This clock used to be used to help a student study for one hour on a particular subject.
            The clock tailors the study session to the current assignment they are working on, and provides them resources they
            can use.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>This context is for studying,specifically for students. It will be used
              by a student when they want to time their study session for an hour, and would like more focus on a particular subject
              they are working on.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Some design choices I made focused on dividing up the canvas into different sections to make it easier
            to see the different information. I decided to color-code them, putting the time in the middle since that is the main focus. I added big text to make it clear what the subject matter
           clear. I wanted to add an interactive element of a button, but due to time, I did not. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong>For the future, I want to increase the interactivity, by adding a fully working button that starts and stops the clock. In addition,
              for the resource section, I want to add links to make it more easy to reach the resources.</li>

          <p>
            Context: This clock used to be used to help a student plan out their study time for an upcoming midterm exam.
            The clock breaks up the time into different activities to help the student prepare effectively.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>This context is for studying for a midterm exam,specifically for students. It will be used
              by a student who needs help on how to prepare for an exam, such as knowing what resources to use and how to divide up their time.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Some design choices I made focused on was having a standard clock, but changing the color arc, for the current time. 
            This was to make it easier to know what the student should be working on at what time. To support this, I added labels at the 12, 3, 6, and 9PM tick
            to make the clock more organized. I also added a clear title and a quick summary so it is easy to know how the clock should be used. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong>For the future, I want to increase the interactivity, a sound such as an alarm after each interval of studying,
            so it is easier for the user to know when to move on </li>

   <!----   <p class="small-note">Replace this entire block with your own text when submitting.</p> -->
          <p>
            Context: This clock is designed for students who are studying at night or in low-light environments.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>This context is for a student who wants to study at night. It is specifically designed to create a calm
            and relaxing environment and aimed at reducing blue light.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Some design choices I made focused on creating a calm environment. I used the structure of the sketch 6
            clock which had a black background. In addition, I changed the text color to a lavender color, to reduce the text brightness. I also added a tab 
           called night mode which a student can turn on, to reduce the blue light emitted. I also added little text tabs that had positive words of affirmation,
          to further create a calming environment for the student. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong>For the future, I want to increase the interactivity, by actually being able to reduce the blue light
            from the person's screen through the night mode button. In addition, I would also like the tabs to move around slowly. </li>
